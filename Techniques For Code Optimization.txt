Techniques For Code Optimization


1. Time Complexity Analysis
- Analyze algorithmic efficiency using Big O notation
- Identify bottlenecks and optimize critical sections
- Minimize nested loops and expensive operations

2. Space Complexity Optimization
- Reduce memory usage by efficient data structures
- Avoid unnecessary data duplication
- Utilize in-place algorithms when possible

3. Caching and Memoization
- Store frequently accessed data in cache
- Implement memoization for expensive function calls
- Leverage caching frameworks and libraries

4. Lazy Evaluation
- Defer expensive computations until needed
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Utilize generators and iterators for efficient iteration

5. Parallelization and Concurrency
- Utilize multi-threading for parallel execution
- Implement asynchronous programming for non-blocking I/O
- Leverage distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark

6. Database Query Optimization
- Analyze and optimize SQL queries
- Utilize indexing and avoid full table scans
- Implement pagination and limit result sets

7. Network and I/O Optimization
- Minimize network requests and payload size
- Compress data before transmission
- Implement caching and content delivery networks (CDNs)

8. Profiling and Performance Monitoring
- Utilize profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks
- Monitor application performance in production
- Continuously iterate and optimize based on metrics
