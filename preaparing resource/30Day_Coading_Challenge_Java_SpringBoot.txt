I'll provide concise answers to your initial 10 questions about Java, then give you 100 more questions divided into medium and hard levels as requested.

1. Main features of Java:
- Platform independence
- Object-oriented
- Robust 
- Multithreaded
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)

2. JDK, JRE, and JVM:
- JDK: Java Development Kit, includes development tools
- JRE: Java Runtime Environment, for running Java applications
- JVM: Java Virtual Machine, executes Java bytecode

3. Abstract class vs. Interface:
- Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods; interface (pre-Java 8) has only abstract methods
- A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class

4. Inheritance in Java:
- Mechanism where a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class
- Supports code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes

5. Polymorphism:
- Compile-time: Method overloading
- Runtime: Method overriding

6. Checked vs. Unchecked exceptions:
- Checked: Compiler-enforced, must be handled or declared
- Unchecked: Runtime exceptions, not enforced by compiler

7. Access modifiers and scope:
- public: Accessible everywhere
- protected: Same package and subclasses
- default (no modifier): Same package only
- private: Same class only

8. String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer:
- String: Immutable
- StringBuilder: Mutable, not thread-safe
- StringBuffer: Mutable, thread-safe

9. == vs. .equals():
- ==: Compares object references
- .equals(): Compares object contents (if properly implemented)

10. Java Collection framework:
- Main interfaces: List, Set, Queue, Map
- Provides implementations like ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, HashMap
