You don’t have enough experience for this role, why should we hire you?”

If you’re faced with this question during an interview, don’t panic. It doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t hire you. The interviewer is essentially asking why they should choose you, despite your lack of experience. Your strategic response can turn their doubt into confidence.

Here’s how to respond:

“I understand that I may not have the exact years of experience you’re looking for, but I bring a strong set of relevant skills and a proven track record of quickly adapting and learning. For instance, in my previous role, I managed [specific tasks] successfully, which directly align with the responsibilities of this position. Additionally, I am genuinely passionate about [industry/role] and am very excited about the possibility of contributing to [company’s name]. I’d be open to discussing a trial period or project to showcase my capabilities and dedication.”

This response will show that you’re:
- Acknowledging the concern
- Demonstrating your adaptability and eagerness to learn
- Highlighting your skills and experience that align with the role

Bonus Tip: After the interview, send a thank-you email expressing your enthusiasm for the role and briefly addressing how you can overcome the experience gap.
