When the recruiter asks for pay slips, how would you respond to the questions:

It’s very important question. As someone who has been on the other side of table, I’ll give you 2 possible answers that can help get the best hike in your current CTC.

Here goes the Number 1:

“Although I wouldn’t mind discussing my salary with you, my non disclosure agreement with employer prevents me from revealing such proprietary information. But, I am open to discussing the salary range you have in mind for this role.

Now, if the recruiter insists - that they need your current CTC, here is your back up plan:

“My current CTC is Rs. 8 lac/annum. Having said that, I have done my research on the salary range for this role and it’s in the range of Rs. 14-18 lac/ annum. I am open to having a discussion and negotiation around this salary range.”

Remember, you need to set anchor high and be assertive about your ask. If it’s within budget, and you’re the right candidate, they WILL give you an offer.
