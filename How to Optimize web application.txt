1. Minimize HTTP requests by bundling and minifying assets (CSS, JS)
2. Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources
3. Use caching techniques (browser caching, server-side caching) to reduce server load
4. Optimize database queries with proper indexing and efficient querying techniques
5. Compress and optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality
6. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets
7. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets from geographically distributed servers
8. Minimize the use of blocking JavaScript and prioritize asynchronous operations
9. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for improved initial page load times
10. Continuously monitor and analyze application performance using tools like Google Lighthouse or New Relic
11. Use Asynchronous technique  e.g. DB writes
12. Connection Pooling Reuse existing database connections
14. load balancing - Distribute incoming requests across multiple server  | Ensure Continuous service even if some server fail.

Optimizing web application performance is crucial for delivering a smooth and responsive user experience. By implementing these techniques and best practices, you can significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and user satisfaction of your web applications.
