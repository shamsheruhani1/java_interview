How To Negotiate Salary

Here is how to answer this question at each stage of the application process:

✅ IN the APPLICATION
Generally, in the application you are answering with just the figure and no explanation. To calculate this figure, here are my tips:
➡️ Share a range always
➡️ Make sure you research the market value for the role
➡️ GOOD PRACTICE - to ensure the lower end of your range is 5-10% higher than your salary expectation
➡️ If you want to know how to research your market value, comment “market value” below and I will DM you.

✅ THE EARLY INTERVIEW PROCESS
➡️ If an employer asks for expected salary at a very early stage and if you don’t fully understand the role, you can say “I don’t fully understand the role/responsibilities for the role so I’m not in a position to state a number. Can we have a more detailed conversation about the role before I mention an expected range?”
➡️ If you understand the role well and you’re offered a pay similar to your current one, highlight the differences in the role from your current one & back this up with market data

✅ THE later stages of interview
➡️ If the offer isn’t upto your expectations and market value, say this -
“I’m really excited to work here, and I know that I will be able to contribute to the company’s vision/goals. I appreciate the offer at $58,000, but was expecting to be in the $65,000-$70,000 range based on my experience, skills, past performance and research. It would be great look at a salary of $65,000 for this position?”
➡️ ALWAYS NEGOTIATE more than your salary. For example, you can ask for :
💫 A signing bonus / Flexible hours / Year End Bonus / Remote work / Learning budget / Equity options
