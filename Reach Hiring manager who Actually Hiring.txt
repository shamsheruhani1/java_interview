👇Step-by-step
 
1. Search Linkedin using “Exact Match”
 
- add your target job title in the search bar

‘project manager AND hiring’

2. Filter for ‘Posts’ in the top bar menu
 
- click the “posts” button; it will turn green
- this should generate a list of people who’ve posted about hiring your target title
- select 10 people and start networking
(you could DM them, or engage their content)
 
3. Refine your search, filter for target companies
 
- click “all filters” in the top bar menu

- type your target companies, and add them
 
This should help refine the list of posts to people hiring for your target position, at your target firms.
