There’s nothing more frustrating than failing to convey your qualifications during interviews 😓

I experienced this firsthand, screwing up four job interviews because I couldn’t properly explain my projects 😒

The turning point came when I started using a ‘Project Breakdown Framework 🚀’

The project breakdown framework isn’t just about recounting events; it’s about structuring your explanation in a clear, concise, and impactful way.

Here’s how I transformed my project explanations:

📌Summarise in One Sentence
Start with a concise summary that encapsulates the project’s purpose and outcome. Instead of, “I worked on a software development project,” I began with, “I led a project to develop a feature that increased user engagement by 20%.”

📌Define the Problem
Clearly articulate the problem you aimed to solve. Instead of vague descriptions, I used specifics: “Our user engagement was dropping by 10% quarterly, impacting revenue.”

📌Outline the Approach
Break down your approach step-by-step. I detailed my method: “I conducted user research, identified key pain points, collaborated with UX designers, and iteratively tested solutions.”

📌Highlight Key Actions
Focus on the most impactful actions you took. For example, “I implemented a new recommendation algorithm that personalized user experiences, leading to a significant engagement boost.”

📌Quantify the Results
Always back your story with data. Instead of general success claims, I stated, “This led to a 30% increase in user interaction within the first week of launch.”

📌Reflect on the Impact
Conclude with the broader impact and any lessons learned. I shared, “The project not only met our engagement goals but also improved my skills in data-driven decision-making and cross-functional collaboration.”

Using this project breakdown framework, I prepped in advance, planned at least 4 stories prior to my interview and ensured I had a list of questions to ask 🚀

What next? My performance improved dramatically and I finally landed a Public Sector Job. Want my viral interview prep checklist and details to a special interview prep guide? Just comment ‘story’ and I’ll DM it to you 🫂🤍
