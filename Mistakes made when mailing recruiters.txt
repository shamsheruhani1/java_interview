Mistakes I made when mailing recruiters many years ago. Read on.

 Did not search for job role on careers page and asked other person to do it.
 I did not specify even a single line about my skill sets in the mail.
 Email formatting sucked so bad.
 Unoptimised resume. ⁃ Did not care to follow up.
 Used very generic sentences I found on internet.
 
 Recruiters get thousands of mails, if you want yours to stand out. Keep it crisp and to the point.
 1) 1-2 lines about your skill sets and interest. 
 2) No long paragraphs in email. 
 3) Provide job link you're interested to apply. 
 4) Email atleast 10-20 people, not just a couple, 
 5) Follow up multiple times.
